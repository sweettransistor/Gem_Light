# Bluetooth App for Custom Gems LED Stand
## This app interfaces with the custom art Gemstone Stands created by sweettransistor. The RGB LEDs embedded in the custom 3D printed stand are controlled wirelessly via this app. 
### This app sends commands to the nrf52832 raytac module onboard the PCB designed and assembled by sweettransistor.
### The Raytac Bluetooth module is also programmed with several color variations and light patterns.
## This project can be seen at www.sweettransistor.com upon completion.
